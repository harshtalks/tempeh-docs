## Router Config API

in Tempeh, working with routes is fairly easy and all the necessary apis can be retrieved through the `routerBuilder.instance` function that will be lazily called by user in a`router.config.ts` File.

```tsx twoslash [route.config.ts]
import { routeBuilder } from "tempeh";

const { Navigate, createRoute, useTempehRouter } = routeBuilder.getInstance({
  // we can add additional base urls here.
  // For example, if we have a SSO setup and auth service is on a different domain.
  additionalBaseUrls: {
    API: "https://api.example.com",
    AUTH: "https://auth.example.com",
  },
  // since we primarily want to manage the Next.js routes.
  defaultBaseUrl: "/",
  // Zod errors can be formatted to be more readable. default is true
  formattedValidationErrors: true,
});

export { Navigate, createRoute, useTempehRouter };
```

We got three main functions from the `routerBuilder.getInstance` function:

1. `Navigate`: This function is used to navigate to a different route. Think of it as a `Link` component in Next.js. where you can pass the pathname, searchParams, etc. and the base urls will be taken from one of the base urls provided in the `router.config.ts` file.
2. `createRoute`: This function is used to create a route. This gives us the utilities to create declarative routes in our Next.js application. read more at [routes page.](/route)
3. `useTempehRouter`: This is a hook that can be used to get the current route information. This is patched with the Next.js router object and can be used to get the current route information. It gives better `push` and `refresh` functions than the default Next.js router object as it has an internal route builder engine.

### Navigate

```tsx [app/page.tsx]
// [!include route.config.ts]
import { Navigate } from "./route.config";
// Home.tsx
import * as React from "react";

export const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home</h1>
      <Navigate
        base="AUTH"
        path={"/sign-in"}
        queryParams={{
          redirectUrl: "https://example.com",
        }}
      >
        Home
      </Navigate>
    </div>
  );
};
```

As you can see, we are using the `Navigate` component to navigate to a different route.

### createRoute

```tsx [app/page.tsx]
import { object } from "zod";
import * as React from "react";
import { createRoute } from "./route.config.ts";

const {
  Link,
  params,
  searchParams,
  useParams,
  useRouter,
  useSafeParams,
  useSafeSearchParams,
  useSearchParams,
} = createRoute({
  name: "/",
  fn: () => "/",
  paramsSchema: object({}),
});

export const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```

As you can see, we are using the `createRoute` function to create a route. This gives us the utilities to create declarative routes in our Next.js application.

- `Link`: This is a component that can be used to link any page to the `/` route (name of the route provided in the `createRoute` function).
- `params`: This should only be used to get the type of the params object. i.e. `const params =  typeof params`. Using it as values will throw an error.
- `searchParams`: This should only be used to get the type of the searchParams object. i.e. `const searchParams =  typeof searchParams`. Using it as values will throw an error.
- `useParams`: This is a hook that can be used to get the params of the current route. if the params of the url are not valid as per the schema, it will throw an error.
- `useSearchParams`: This is a hook that can be used to get the searchParams of the current route. if the searchParams of the url are not valid as per the schema, it will throw an error.
- `useRouter`: This is a hook that can be used to get the Next.js router object.
- `useSafeParams`: This is a hook that can be used to get the params of the current route. if the params of the url are not valid as per the schema, it will return a union of `error` or valid `route params`.
- `useSafeSearchParams`: This is a hook that can be used to get the searchParams of the current route. if the searchParams of the url are not valid as per the schema, it will return a union of `error` or valid `route searchParams`.

#### Using the `useRouter` hook returned from the `createRoute` function

```tsx [app/page.tsx]
// file name = "app/workspace/[workspaceid]/page.tsx"
import { object, string } from "zod";

const workspaceRouteInfo = createRoute({
  name: "/workspace/:workspaceId",
  fn: ({ workspaceId }) => `/workspace/${workspaceId}`,
  paramsSchema: object({
    workspaceId: string(),
  }),
});

// using in another File: app/components/header.tsx
import { workspaceRouteInfo } from "../page";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";
import { useEffect } from "react";

export const Home = () => {
  const router = workspaceRouteInfo.useRouter(useRouter);

  useEffect(() => {
    // read the workspaceId from the local Storage
    const workspaceId = localStorage.getItem("workspaceId");
    if (workspaceId) {
      router.push({
        params: { workspaceId },
      });
    }
  }, []);
  return (
    <>
      <header>
        <Logo />
        <nav>
          {/**
        navbar stuff
        */}
        </nav>
      </header>
      <main></main>
    </>
  );
};
```

As you can see here, we are using the `useRouter` hook returned from the `createRoute` function to get the Next.js router object. This can be used to push to a different route, refresh the current route, etc. We need to pass the `useRouter` hook to the `useRouter` function to get the Next.js router object. This is done to make sure that the Next.js router object is patched with the route builder engine. You can also pass your own patched router object to the `useRouter` function of created tempeh route as long as it has the same shape as the Next.js router object.
