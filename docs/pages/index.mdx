## What is tempeh?

<strong>Tempeh</strong> is a Next.js library that allows you to create typesafe route
builders to generate URLs for your route handlers and pages. Tempeh uses zod and
advanced generics of typescript under the hood to provide you with rich flexible
apis to build your routes.

<strong>Tempeh</strong> also creates a wrapper for useSearchParams and useParams
to give you typesafe access to the query and route params for each and every page.

Another feature of <strong>Tempeh</strong> is the ability to create a custom fetcher function with typesafety using zod. With the help of powerful apis of zod, we can create robust typesafe production ready application with ease.

<strong>Tempeh</strong> is currently in the version ^1.0.1 and is in active development.
If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to open an issue on the github
