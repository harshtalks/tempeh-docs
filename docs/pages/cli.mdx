# Tempeh CLI

I have made a CLI for Tempeh to fasten up the process of defining routes in your Next.js application.

- All the boilerplate code will be created for you.
- If there are existing routes in your application, it will define declarative route objects for them.
- You can also programatically create routes as you keep adding new routes to your application.

### Installation

You can install the CLI using npm, yarn, pnpm or bun.

#### Global Installation

```bash [Terminal]
npx install -g tempeh-cli
```

#### Local Installation

```bash [Terminal]
npx tempeh-cli init
```

### Usage

Tempeh-cli provides you with a 2 commands to get started with Tempeh.
- init
- update

#### init
- This command will create all the boilerplate code for you to get started with Tempeh.
- Installs zod and tempeh as dependencies in your project.
- Defines declarative route objects for existing routes in your application.

```bash [Terminal]

#### update
- This command will generate route objects for new routes that you have added to your application.
- It will not override the existing route objects.
