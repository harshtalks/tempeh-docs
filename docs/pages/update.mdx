# Tempeh Version 5

I have updated the Tempeh to version 5. This version has a lot of new features and improvements and also some breaking changes. I have updated the documentation to reflect the changes in the new version.

1. No longer providing fetcher function in the route object. Instead, you can use better fetch wrappers like wretch, kv, or @effect/platform.
2. Optimised `routeBuilder` as the previous singleton pattern was causing major performance issues.
3. New closure based approach for `routeBuilder` to provide better type safety. You can multiple instances of routeBuilder however it is not recommended.
4. Fewer APIs returned by `createRoute` to improve DX. useParams and useSafeParams are merged into a single `useParams` hook. Similarly, useSearchParams and useSafeSearchParams are merged into a single `useSearchParams` hook.
5. We no longer keep track of all your routes in an internal object as it was causing performance issues. Instead, we only keep track of the base urls and the route configs.
6. Test coverage has been improved.
